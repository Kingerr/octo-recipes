Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches

Prep time - 10 minutes

Cook time - 20 minutes

Ingredients:

 2 lb of chicken breasts

 some bread product to put the sandwich on (I used onion rolls)

 three cloves of garlic

 about a cup of Frank's Hot Sauce

 1/2 of a red onion

 2-3 celery stalks

 8 oz. of cream cheese

 blue cheese crumbles

 a little paprika and/or cumin

 salt

 pepper

Directions:

 mince garlic, chop onion finely, and dice the celery and put over low heat
   with some olive oil, stirring often

 while the veggies are cooking a little (not really sauteing or browning
   hopefully), cube the chicken breast.  Heat through in a large pan.

 after the chicken is cooking, add the hot sauce and spices to the sauce,
   and stir through

 when the chicken is about cooked, turn off the heat on the sauce and add the
   cream cheese and stir through

 when all of the cream cheese is blended, and the chicken is done, pour the
   sauce over the chicken and stir

 cook for another few minutes to blend the flavors a bit

 toast the bread if you want, and spoon the chicken mixture over the bread
   and top with blue cheese crumbles
